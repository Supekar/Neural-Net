# Neural-Net
Implemented a 1 hidden layer neural net with variable number of epochs, learning rate and number of hidden layer with numpy. neural.py implements the back propagation algorithm to update the weights. A final pass on the testing data after trainings the weights on number of epochs gives us the accuracy of the model on classification of 10 output labels.
