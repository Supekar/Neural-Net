# Neural-Net
Implemented a 1 hidden layer neural net with variable number of epochs, learning rate and number of hidden layer with numpy. neural.py implements the back propagation algorithm to update the weights. A final pass on the testing data after trainings the weights on number of epochs gives us the accuracy of the model on classification of 10 output labels. 
The neural nets is implemented on a subset 10 of the total labels of optical character recognition data set
